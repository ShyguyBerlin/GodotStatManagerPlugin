# GodotStatManagerPlugin
Hey! you just found my plugin for Godot 4.x.
It's still in early alpha, so don't expect much... or anything at this point.
I'm currently figuring out how to structure the API on the core level, so this might take a while.
## Important disclaimers
Although this project is public, it still is a personal project, that I want to develop mostly alone.
I made it public for the reason, that it might be useful to anyone and after I stop developing it, more motivated and/or intelligent people can take on the project.
## How to contribute
If you see potential in this, you might message me somehow or fork the project. You can use other means of github to contribute, but I'm not very active unless I commit some changes.
## What to expect in the end
A plugin for Godot x.x, that mainly provides some classes and one or two singletons, to manage game-character related stats, such as health, speed, attack, etc., all being customizable for the project you're building.
